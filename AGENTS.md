# Repository Collaboration Rules

## Multi-Template Change Confirmation

When a request could apply to both dashboard templates (`Index.html` and `IndexMECOE.html`), ask this before implementing:

`Should I update both templates or only one?`

If the user explicitly names one file/template, update only that one.
If the user says "both", implement equivalent changes in both where applicable.
